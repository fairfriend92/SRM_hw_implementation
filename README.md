# SRM_hw_implementation
VHDL implementation of the Spike Response Model

This is a hardware implementation, written in VHDL, of the <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/97804/files/SRM.pdf">Spike Response Model</a>. In particular, it adopts the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.10.009.2009/full">Multi-timescale Adaptive Neuronal Threshold model</a>. For a brief overview of the project, take a look at this <a href="https://github.com/fairfriend92/SRM_hw_implementation/blob/main/presentazione.pdf">presentation</a>.
